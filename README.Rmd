## Installation

You can install the development version of mmdb from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("xprimexinverse/mmdb")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mmdb)

trend <- new("series-obj", description="Trend", raw_data = ts(1:10, start = c(2000, 1), frequency = 4))
time  <- new("series-obj", description="Time", raw_data = ts(seq(from = 2000, length.out = 10, by = 0.25), start = c(2000, 1), frequency = 4))

my_db <- mmdb::create_db()

x <- new("series-obj", description="X", raw_data = ts(rnorm(15), start = c(1999, 1), frequency = 4), table = "rnorm", units = "number")
y <- new("series-obj", description="Y", raw_data = ts(rnorm(30), start = c(1999, 1), frequency = 4), table = "rnorm", units = "number")

my_db <- mmdb::add_db(my_db, x)
my_db <- mmdb::add_db(my_db, y)

head(my_db@db,n=10)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
